## Front-End Developer Landing Page
This HTML file displays the stylish landing page of a front-end developer. This file was developed using HTML and SCSS.

## Installation
This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install. Simply open up the HTML file in your web browser. If you would like to fork the design, make sure you have a SASS Compiler installed in your Microsoft Visual Studio Code app to convert the SCSS file to CSS. Without the compiler, the SCSS version would not render any stylish changes to the HTML file.

## Project Status
The project runs as expected.The HTML file doesn't display the view, thus, you will need to view the front-end version in the link provided below.

## Live Version
